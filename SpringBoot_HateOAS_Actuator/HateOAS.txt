HATEOAS in Spring Boot
HATEOAS is the concept within REST that enables the client to interact with the RESTful service entirely through hyperlinks provided dynamically by the service itself. It means the client does not need to hardcode the URIs of the resource but can discover them at runtime.

In Spring Boot, HATEOAS can be implemented using the spring-boot-starter-hateoas dependency which allows the easy creation of hypermedia links and resources. With HATEOAS each resource representation returned by the server can contain the links to related resources or actions that the client can follow.
